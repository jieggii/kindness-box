# Routers

Routers is must important part of any bot in VkWave. Routers contains handlers, thanks to which the event processing is carried out

``` python
from vkwave.bots import DefaultRouter

router = DefaultRouter()
```

You can pass [filters](filters/index.en.md) when creating a router (add a default filters), thanks to which events will process faster.

``` python
router = DefaultRouter(SomeFilter())


@bots.simple_bot_message_handler(
    router,
    <filters>
)
async def handler(ans: bots.SimpleBotEvent):
    await ans.answer(
        "answer",
    )
```
